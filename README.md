# **RecyclerView Implementation with Retrofit in Kotlin**

This project demonstrates how to implement a RecyclerView in Kotlin to display data fetched from an API using Retrofit. RecyclerView is a powerful component in Android development for efficiently displaying large sets of data. Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, which makes it easy to consume RESTful web services.

## **Features**
* Fetch data from an API using Retrofit.
* Display the fetched data in a RecyclerView.
* Handle click events on RecyclerView items.
  
## **Dependencies**
* Kotlin
* Retrofit
* RecyclerView
* Gson (for JSON serialization/deserialization)
* Glide (for faster image loading)
## **Getting Started**
* Clone the repository:
 ``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RecyclerView-Retrofit-Kotlin.git```
* Open the project in Android Studio.
* Build and run the project on an emulator or a physical device

## **Usage**
* Upon launching the app, the data will be fetched from the API and displayed in the RecyclerView.
* Scroll through the list to view all items.
* Click on an item to view more details or perform any desired action.
